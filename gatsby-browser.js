//gatsby-browser.js is one of a handful of special files that Gatsby looks for and uses 
//Note: Both CommonJS (require) and ES Module (import) syntax work here. If youâ€™re not sure which to choose, import is usually a good default. When working with files that are only run in a Node.js environment however (like gatsby-node.js), require will need to be used.
